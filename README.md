Must import the json libraray in order to run this program. The used secrets.py files must be all lowercase. This program will fetch data from the api data base including: 
    school.name
    school.city
    2018.student.size
    2017.student.size
    2017.earnings.3_yrs_after_completion.overall_count_over_poverty_line
    2016.repayment.3_yr_repayment.overall
This totals 3203 entries which takes up 161 pages of 20 entries each. Once sucessfully retreived, the data will be written to a file titled api_data. Note that the data
takes a while to retrieve. The program will print out a message indicating the data has been written to the file. The data should be cleanly saved in the .txt file with
about 8 lines per entry.
